**What is MERN Stack?**
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB — document database
Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server
Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.
